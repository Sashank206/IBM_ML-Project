# IBM_ML-Project
Tele-Law Case Registration Prediction is a data-driven machine learning project that aims to uncover disparities in legal aid access across Indian states and districts. Despite the nationwide rollout of the Tele-Law initiative, there remain significant gaps in service utilization among different demographic and regional groups, especially marginalized communities such as SC, ST, and OBC.

This project uses IBM Watsonx.ai AutoAI, an automated machine learning tool, to build a regression model that predicts the total number of Tele-Law case registrations in each district. The prediction is based on several features, including:

Gender-wise case counts (Male, Female)

Caste-wise data (SC, ST, OBC, General)

Number of Common Service Centres (CSCs)

State and District information

The model helps identify patterns of underutilization and regional disparities in access to legal services. This enables data-driven decision-making to improve inclusivity, optimize CSC deployment, and strengthen the reach of Tele-Law services to underserved populations.

AutoAI automates the entire machine learning workflow, including data preprocessing, feature engineering, algorithm selection, model evaluation, and deployment. The top-performing model is selected based on regression metrics like RÂ² Score, MAE, and RMSE, and is deployed for real-time prediction and analysis.
